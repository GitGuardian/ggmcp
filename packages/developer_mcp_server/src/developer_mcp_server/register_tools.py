# GitGuardian Developer Tools for Secret Detection & Remediation

This server provides GitGuardian's secret detection and remediation capabilities through MCP for developers working within IDE environments like Cursor, Windsurf, or Zed.

## Secret Management Capabilities

This server focuses on helping developers manage secrets in their repositories through:

1. **Finding Existing Secret Incidents**:
   - Detect secrets already identified as GitGuardian incidents in your repository
   - Use `list_repo_incidents` to view all secret incidents in a repository
   - Filter incidents by various criteria including those assigned to you

2. **Proactive Secret Scanning**:
   - Use `scan_secrets` to detect secrets in code before they're committed
   - Identify secrets that haven't yet been reported as GitGuardian incidents
   - Prevent accidental secret commits before they happen

3. **Complete Secret Remediation**:
   - Use `remediate_secret_incidents` for guided secret removal
   - Get best practice recommendations for different types of secrets
   - Replace hardcoded secrets with environment variables
   - Create .env.example files with placeholders for detected secrets
   - Get optional git commands to repair git history containing secrets

4. **Generate and hide honey tokens**:
   - Use `generate_honey_tokens` to generate and hide honey tokens
   - If you want to create a new token, you must pass new_token=True to generate_honey_tokens
   - hide the generated token in the codebase


All tools operate within your IDE environment to provide immediate feedback and remediation steps for secret management.
