    Create code fix requests for multiple secret incidents with their locations.

    This will generate pull requests to automatically remediate the detected secrets.
    Each request must include one or more issues (by issue_id) and one or more
    location IDs for each issue.

    The system will group locations by source repository and create one pull request per source.

    Args:
        params: CreateCodeFixRequestParams model containing:
            - locations: List of issues with their location IDs to fix

    Returns:
        CreateCodeFixRequestResult: Pydantic model containing:
            - message: Success message with count of created requests and locations
            - success: Whether the request was successful
            - Additional fields from the API response

    Raises:
        ToolError: If the request fails due to:
            - 400: Invalid input or business rule violation (e.g., feature disabled,
                   too many locations, no valid locations, already being fixed)
            - 403: Insufficient permissions (not an account admin or missing API scope)
            - 404: API key not configured (on-prem only)

    Examples:
        Single issue with multiple locations:
        ```python
        params = CreateCodeFixRequestParams(
            locations=[
                LocationToFix(issue_id=12345, location_ids=[67890, 67891, 67892])
            ]
        )
        ```

        Multiple issues from different sources:
        ```python
        params = CreateCodeFixRequestParams(
            locations=[
                LocationToFix(issue_id=12345, location_ids=[67890]),
