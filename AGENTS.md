# Project structure, technologies and architecture conventions

## Technologies used


-   **uv** - Fast Python package installer and resolver
-   **Python 3.11** - Modern Python with type hints and performance improvements
-   **FastMCP** - MCP server implementation
-   **Pytest** - Testing framework with fixtures and plugins
-   **Pydantic** - Data validation using Python type annotations
-   **Structlog** - Structured logging for better observability

## Dependencies Management

1. **Use pyproject.toml with uv**
   - Use `pyproject.toml` for dependency management, not requirements.txt
   - Works well with `uv` for fast, reliable package management
   - Properly specify dependencies with version constraints
   - Use `uv sync` to install dependencies

2. **Example pyproject.toml**
   ```toml
   [build-system]
   requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel"]
   build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

   [project]
   name = "my-mcp-server"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "My MCP server"
   requires-python = ">=3.9"
   dependencies = [
       "mcp>=0.2.0",
       "requests>=2.28.0",
   ]
   ```

## Server Implementation Guidelines

1. **Do NOT use uvicorn or fastapi with MCP/FastMCP**
   - MCP has its own server implementation
   - FastMCP/MCP can run directly using `mcp.run()` with no need for external web servers
   - Avoid adding uvicorn or fastapi to dependencies
   - Do not use `uvicorn.run(...)` in code

2. **Use the correct server method**
   - Use `mcp.run()` to start the server (no additional parameters needed for stdio transport)
   - Example: `mcp.run()` instead of `uvicorn.run(mcp.app, ...)`

3. **Dependencies**
   - Only include required dependencies
   - For basic MCP implementation, only `mcp` or `fastmcp` and possibly `requests` are needed
   - Do not include web server packages unnecessarily



## Code Organization and Imports

1. **Use `src` as the root code directory**
   - Ensure all code is placed within the `src` directory
   - Handle imports accordingly by using the appropriate package path
   - Example: `from src.gitguardian.your_module import YourClass`

2. **FastMCP imports must use the correct package path**
   - All imports concerning FastMCP must be done under `mcp.server.fastmcp`
   - Example: `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` instead of direct imports

This guide ensures all MCP implementations follow the project's standards of using native capabilities rather than external web servers.


# Lower level Python rules

## General Guidelines

-   Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
-   Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
-   Keep imports organized and sorted
-   Don't use lazy/deferred imports, except inside Celery tasks definitions

## Running tests

To run the tests, `uv run pytest`

## Creating tests :

- We use pytest, and plain classes. Don't use unittest classes
- Use project fixtures (`test_account`, `owner_client`, `api_client`) instead of creating new instances
- file naming convention : `test_<whatever>.py`
- don't use self.assertEqual (and so on) helpers but only assert
- The docstring of every test function must follow this format :

```
"""
GIVEN ...
WHEN ...
THEN ...
"""
```

## Variable names

Use clear variable and function names that indicate their purpose without being overly verbose.
Follow established conventions where appropriate (e.g., `i` for loop indices, `df` for dataframes),
but ensure non-standard names are self-explanatory.
For example, prefer `calculate_user_discount(price, user_tier)` over `calc(p, t)`, but `i` is perfectly fine for a simple loop counter.


## **all** Lists

-   Add an `__all__` list when using `import *` imports
-   When provided, the `__all__ = []` list must be ordered alphabetically
-   When adding new items to `__all__`, maintain alphabetical order
-   Example:
    ```python
    __all__ = [
        "ClassA",
        "ClassB",
        "function_a",
        "function_b",
    ]
    ```

## Typing

- Use typing for function signatures and return values
- Don't use `from typing import List` but rather `list`
