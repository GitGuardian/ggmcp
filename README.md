# GitGuardian MCP Server

Stay focused on building your product while your AI assistant handles the security heavy lifting with GitGuardian's comprehensive protection.

This MCP server enables your AI agent to scan projects using GitGuardian's industry-leading API, featuring over 500 secret detectors to prevent credential leaks before they reach public repositories.

Resolve security incidents without context switching to the GitGuardian console. Take advantage of rich contextual data to enhance your agent's remediation capabilities, enabling rapid resolution and automated removal of hardcoded secrets.

## Disclaimer

> [!CAUTION]
> MCP servers are an emerging and rapidly evolving technology. While they can significantly boost productivity and improve the developer experience, their use with various agents and models should always be supervised.
>
> Agents act on your behalf and under your responsibility. Always use MCP servers from trusted sources (just as you would with any dependency), and carefully review agent actions when they interact with MCP server tools.
>
> To better assist you in safely using this server, we have:
>
> (1) Designed our MCP server to operate with "read-only" permissions, minimizing the access level granted to your agent. This helps ensure that, even if the agent tries to perform unintended actions, its capabilities remain limited to safe, non-destructive operations.
>
> (2) Released this official MCP server to ensure you are using a legitimate and trusted implementation.

The MCP server supports both GitGuardian SaaS and self-hosted instances.

### Installation with Cursor

**Quick Install with One-Click Buttons** (Cursor >= 1.0):

For Developer MCP Server:

[![Install Developer MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=GitGuardianDeveloper&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IC0tZnJvbSBnaXQraHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL0dpdEd1YXJkaWFuL2dnLW1jcC5naXQgZGV2ZWxvcGVyLW1jcC1zZXJ2ZXIiLCJlbnYiOnt9fQ%3D%3D)

> **Note**: The one-click install sets up the default US SaaS configuration. For EU SaaS or self-hosted instances, you'll need to manually add environment variables as shown in the [Configuration section](#configuration-for-different-gitguardian-instances).

**Manual Configuration**:

1. Edit your Cursor MCP configuration file located at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

2. Add the GitGuardian MCP server configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": [
           "--from",
           "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git",
           "developer-mcp-server"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Installation with Claude Desktop

1. Edit your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file located at:

   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude Desktop/mcp.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude Desktop\mcp.json`

2. Add the GitGuardian MCP server configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
         "command": "/path/to/uvx",
         "args": [
           "--from",
           "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git",
           "developer-mcp-server"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace `/path/to/uvx` with the **absolute path** to the uvx executable on your system.

   > ⚠️ **WARNING**: For Claude Desktop, you must specify the full absolute path to the `uvx` executable, not just `"command": "uvx"`. This is different from other MCP clients.

4. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.

### Installation with Windsurf

To use the GitGuardian MCP server with [Windsurf](https://www.windsurf.ai/):

1. Edit your Windsurf MCP configuration file located at:

   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/mcp.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Windsurf\mcp.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Windsurf/mcp.json`

2. Add the following entry to the configuration file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "servers": {
         "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
           "type": "stdio",
           "command": "uvx",
           "args": [
             "--from",
             "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git",
             "developer-mcp-server"
           ]

         "args": [
           "--from",
           "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git",
           "developer-mcp-server"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Authentication Process

1. When you start the server, it will automatically open a browser window to authenticate with GitGuardian
2. After you log in to GitGuardian and authorize the application, you'll be redirected back to the local server
3. The authentication token will be securely stored for future use
4. The next time you start the server, it will reuse the stored token without requiring re-authentication

## Configuration for Different GitGuardian Instances

The MCP server uses OAuth authentication and defaults to GitGuardian SaaS (US region) at `https://dashboard.gitguardian.com`. For other instances, you'll need to specify the URL:

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `GITGUARDIAN_URL` | GitGuardian instance URL | `https://dashboard.gitguardian.com` | `https://dashboard.eu1.gitguardian.com` |
| `GITGUARDIAN_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client ID | `ggshield_oauth` | `my-custom-oauth-client` |
| `GITGUARDIAN_SCOPES` | OAuth scopes to request | Auto-detected based on instance type | `scan,incidents:read,sources:read,honeytokens:read,honeytokens:write` |
| `GITGUARDIAN_TOKEN_NAME` | Name for the OAuth token | Auto-generated based on server type | `"Developer MCP Token"` |
| `GITGUARDIAN_TOKEN_LIFETIME` | Token lifetime in days | `30` | `60` or `never` |
| `MCP_PORT` | Port for HTTP/SSE transport (when set, enables HTTP transport instead of stdio) | Not set (uses stdio) | `8000` |
| `MCP_HOST` | Host address for HTTP/SSE transport | `127.0.0.1` | `0.0.0.0` |

### HTTP/SSE Transport

By default, the MCP server uses **stdio transport** for local IDE integrations. If you need to expose the MCP server over HTTP (for remote access or custom integrations), you can use the `MCP_PORT` and `MCP_HOST` environment variables.

#### Enabling HTTP Transport

To enable HTTP/SSE transport, set the `MCP_PORT` environment variable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git",
        "developer-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_PORT": "8000",
        "MCP_HOST": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Running the server directly with HTTP transport

You can also run the server directly with HTTP transport:

```bash
# Run with HTTP transport
MCP_PORT=8000 MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 uvx --from git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git developer-mcp-server
```

The server will automatically start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and be accessible for remote integrations.

#### Authentication via Authorization Header

When using HTTP/SSE transport, you can authenticate using a Personal Access Token (PAT) via the `Authorization` header. This is useful for remote integrations where environment variables or OAuth flows are not practical.

**Supported header formats:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `Authorization: Token <token>`
- `Authorization: <token>`

**Example using curl:**

```bash
# List available tools
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/tools/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Call a tool
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/tools/call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "get_authenticated_user_info", "arguments": {}}'
```

**Example using Python:**

```python
import httpx

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000/tools/list",
        headers=headers,
        json={}
    )
    tools = response.json()
```

**Authentication Priority:**

When using HTTP transport, the authentication priority is:
1. **Authorization header** (if present in the HTTP request)
2. **GITGUARDIAN_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN** environment variable
3. **OAuth flow** (default fallback)

This allows different clients to use different authentication methods when connecting to the same HTTP server instance.

**Notes:**
- `uvicorn` is included as a dependency - no additional installation needed.
- When `MCP_PORT` is not set, the server uses stdio transport (default behavior).
- `MCP_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). Use `0.0.0.0` to allow connections from any network interface.
- The HTTP/SSE transport is useful for remote access, but stdio is recommended for local IDE integrations.
- Each HTTP request can have its own Authorization header, allowing multi-tenant use cases.

### Self-Hosted GitGuardian

For self-hosted GitGuardian instances, add the `GITGUARDIAN_URL` environment variable to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git", "developer-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GITGUARDIAN_URL": "https://dashboard.gitguardian.mycorp.local"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Self-Hosted with Honeytoken Support

If your self-hosted instance has honeytokens enabled and your user has the required permissions ("manager" role), you can explicitly request honeytoken scopes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git", "developer-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GITGUARDIAN_URL": "https://dashboard.gitguardian.mycorp.local",
        "GITGUARDIAN_SCOPES": "scan,incidents:read,sources:read,honeytokens:read,honeytokens:write"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### GitGuardian EU Instance

For the GitGuardian EU instance, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git", "developer-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GITGUARDIAN_URL": "https://dashboard.eu1.gitguardian.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom OAuth Client

If you have your own OAuth application configured in GitGuardian, you can specify a custom client ID:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GitGuardianDeveloper": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp.git", "developer-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GITGUARDIAN_CLIENT_ID": "my-custom-oauth-client"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
